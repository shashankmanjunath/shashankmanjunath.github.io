_Abstract:_ Topological data analysis (TDA) is an emerging technique for
biological signal processing. TDA leverages the invariant topological features
of signals in a metric space for robust analysis of signals even in the presence
of noise. In this paper, we leverage TDA on brain connectivity networks derived
from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to identify statistical differences
between pediatric patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and pediatric
patients without OSA. We leverage a large corpus of data, and show that TDA
enables us to see a statistical difference between the brain dynamics of the two
groups.
