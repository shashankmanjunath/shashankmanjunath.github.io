Single particle interferometric reflectance imaging sensor (SP-IRIS) allows for
label-free biological nanoparticle detection. This imaging technique allows
collection of a 3D defocus profile of interferometric signatures of particles on
a reflecting surface. However, automated reconstruction of information from
SP-IRIS data and identification of particles remains a challenge. In this work,
we develop machine learning techniques to perform accurate reconstruction of
defocus profiles from undersampled SP-IRIS data, and machine learning techniques
to segment particles of interest from background in SP-IRIS data. We test the
performance of a direct, single-signal fully connected neural network based
reconstruction technique, an untrained non-convolutional network for
single-signal reconstruction, and a 2D convolutional neural network
reconstruction model for reconstruction of SP-IRIS signal defocus profiles from
undersampled data. We then test a UNet based segmentation model to segment
particle signals from background signals. Lastly, we propose a novel combined
reconstruction and segmentation model which can perform both reconstruction and
segmentation on undersampled SP-IRIS data.
