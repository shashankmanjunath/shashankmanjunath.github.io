I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Northeastern University,
where I work on biological signal processing and machine learning research under
the supervision of Dr. Aarti Sathyanarayana in the [SATH
Lab](https://www.thesathlab.com/).

Prior to starting my Ph.D. at Northeastern, I spent time as a Senior Data
Scientist at Linus Health, where I worked on Linus Health's platform, as well as
at Charles River Analytics as a Scientist where I worked on a variety of signal
processing, machine learning, and computer vision projects. I received a
Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics at Vanderbilt
University in May 2018, where I performed research into signal processing and
computer vision techniques to improve magnetic resonance imaging. I additionally
received a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering at Boston University in May
2022, where I completed a Master's thesis under the supervision of Prof. M.
Selim Ünlü focused on reconstructing undersampled signals from interferometric
imaging techniques.

I am broadly interested developing in novel signal processing and machine
learning techniques and applying them to biological problems. I am interested in
working on problems that push the boundaries of what we can identify out of
low-level signals, as well as projects that involve enhancing signals to greater
clarity.

I currently live in Providence, RI. Outside of work, I enjoy lifting weights, riding motorcycles, cooking, and playing sports.
