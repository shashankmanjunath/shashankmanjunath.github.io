I am broadly interested in developing novel signal processing techniques for
application to biological problems. A small description of my current projects
are described below.

## Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for Electroencephalogram (EEG) Signals

Publications in this area:

- [Topological Data Analysis of Electroencephalogram Signals for Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea](/publication/2023-04-28-tda-eeg-signals-pediatric-osa)
