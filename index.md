Hi, my name is Shashank Manjunath. I'm passionate about signal processing, computer vision, and machine learning. I am
currently a Scientist at Charles River Analytics, where I work on signal processing and computer vision projects. I
received a degree in Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics at Vanderbilt University, where I performed research into
signal processing and computer vision techniques to improve magnetic resonance imaging. I am currently pursuing a
Master's degree at Boston University, with plans to graduate in Spring 2022.

I am broadly interested in novel signal processing techniques. I enjoy working on problems that push the boundaries of
what we can identify out of low-level signals, as well as projects that involve enhancing signals to greater clarity.

I currently live in Cambridge, MA, and grew up in Acton, MA. Outside of work, I enjoy lifting weights, riding
motorcycles, cooking,  and playing sports.
