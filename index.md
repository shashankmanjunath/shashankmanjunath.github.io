Hi, my name is Shashank Manjunath. I'm passionate about signal processing and
machine learning. I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at
Northeastern University, where I work on signal processing and machine learning
research under the supervision of Dr. Aarti Sathyanarayana.

Prior to starting at Norhteastern, I spent time as a Senior Data Scientist at
Linus Health, where I worked on Linus Health's platform, as well as at Charles
River Analytics as a Scientist where I worked on a variety of signal processing,
machine learning, and computer vision projects. I received a Bachelor's degree
in Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics at Vanderbilt University, where I
performed research into signal processing and computer vision techniques to
improve magnetic resonance imaging. I additionally received a Master's degree in
Electrical Engineering at Boston University in May 2022, where I completed a
Master's thesis under the supervision of Prof. M. Selim Ünlü.

I am broadly interested in novel signal processing techniques. I enjoy working
on problems that push the boundaries of what we can identify out of low-level
signals, as well as projects that involve enhancing signals to greater clarity.

I currently live in Providence, RI, and grew up in Acton, MA. Outside of work, I enjoy lifting weights, riding
motorcycles, cooking,  and playing sports.
